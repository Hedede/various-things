This repository consists of various pieces of code that I've written:
- Exercises: solutions to various programming exercises
- Prototypes: complete prototype implementations for stuff that later I implemented somewhere else
- Benchmarks: I compare the speed of multiple implementations against each other
- Snippets: snippets of code of various usefulness that don't compile on their own
- Scripts: useful or not so scripts that work on their own
- Tests: I test whether a snippet of code works or not
- Junk: mostly useless code
